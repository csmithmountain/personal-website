        I’m Christoffer, and Twig is the name I chose for my online presence. It’s what my friends from online communities know me by, and it’s quickly becoming my go-to name across creative social media.

        I have a degree in front-end development, and while I’m proud of what I’ve learned, I feel I still have room to grow technically because I haven’t coded as much as I wanted to. That said, I’m actively working on sharpening my skills every day.

        Alongside development, I’m an aspiring illustrator focused on character art, which I’m teaching myself through practice and exploration. Storytelling and exploring human emotions inspire my work — whether through code or drawing.

        Creativity comes naturally to me, and I enjoy looking at things from fresh perspectives. I learn quickly and love gathering the knowledge I need to grow. My big goal is to become a full-time artist and share my stories and characters with the world.

        When I’m not creating or working, I recharge in nature, finding inspiration in the small details around me. I’m also a fan of fantasy and sci-fi — from <em>The Magicians</em> to <em>Lord of the Rings</em> — and enjoy crafting, photography, and video games to relax and spark ideas.

      <p>Thanks for visiting, I’m excited to share my journey with you!</p>
